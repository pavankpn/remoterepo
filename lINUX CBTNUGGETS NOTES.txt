01 - Intro

02 - Integrated Hardware Devices
- BIOS or UEFI
- Device Layout
- Tools

BIOS - UEFI
- Can't unplug onboard devices!
- Some configuration is outside of the os (like Keyboard handling)
- Usually press F1,F10,F11,Del
	(If you don't see a message in POST, guess!)

Everything is a File
-  /dev/___
- Files are pointers to devices
- Hard Drives & Partitions
 Ex: /dev/sda (Serial ATA drive no 1)	
Common Names
- eth0, eth1, eth2 (Ether net card)
- sda, sdb, sdc   (Serial ATA Hard drive, USB drives also )
- hda, hdb, hdc    (IDE Hard drives)
- md0  (Raid Controler Device)
- video0 (Webcams)
  etc....
  
$ cd /etc/dev/
$ ls
 sda   Hard Disk
 sda1  Hard Disk Partition 1
 sda2  Hard Disk Partition 2
 sda5  Hard Disk Partition 3
 
 cdrom is simlink to sr0
 tty  are virtual terminals
 
 In Linux Drivers are in Kernel Modules.
 $lsmod   List of active modules that are currently running on system.
 Ex: Ac97 (Sound card drivers)
 
 If hardware device is not detected then we add module to the kernel then the hardware gets detectedtected
 to do that use below command.
 $ modprobe - program to add and remove modules from the Linux Kernel
   
 
03 - Removable Devices
- Mass Storage Devices
- Coldplug VS Hotplug
- lsusb, lspci, dmesg (Tools)
 $lsusb  - List USB Devicess.
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	

04 - Dealing with Devices  procfs, sysfs, udev, and dbus

Procfs  -- proc file system
		A tale of procfs

- In Unix and Linux, everything is a file.
- Process info was put into a virtual filesystem,  /proc/
- It was so cool, it got messy
